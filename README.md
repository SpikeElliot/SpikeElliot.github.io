## [Fitter: Social Media Web Application](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Social-Fitness-Web-App)

A fitness-based social media platform built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL. Users can:

- Connect their account to the Strava API to view their exercise data on the activities page 
- Create public posts (optionally connected to activities)
- Search for, comment on, and like posts
- View other usersâ€™ profiles and follow them.

## [Gamified Guitar Song Learning Application (WIP)](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Gamified-Guitar-Song-Learning)

Currently work in progress, this standalone Python software built with PyQt assists guitarists in the process of learning a song by ear. 

A pre-trained Machine Learning model is implemented to extract the guitar from an audio file. A user can then play along to the separated track with their connected electric guitar in a virtual practise environment providing audio playback options (e.g. play/pause, looping sections, adjusting speed).

Also implemented is a karaoke-style note accuracy score derived from the the user's "closeness" to the original guitar track through use of audio analysis functions from the Librosa library. This gives the user real-time feedback on performance as well as providing a gamified experience.

## [Karaoke and Rhythm Game](https://github.com/sahas036211/p5-Karaoke-and-Rhythm-Game)

This small piece of software was built using the p5.js library and houses two separate games alongside a music player with various visualisers to select.

The rhythm game features procedural real-time note generation synchronised to the song's tempo, an in-depth scoring system, difficulty options that adjust note spawn rates, and 3D graphics rendering of game environment.

The music player showcases various visualisations, audio playback controls, a clickable progress bar, and a webcam input integrated visualisation through use of p5's FFT functions.

## [Hangman Game](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Java-Hangman-Game)

An endless hangman game designed as a small test application with Java Swing. The GUI provides a text box and button to guess letters, and updates the necessary game information. When a player runs out of lives, their final score is displayed and they are prompted to try again.

## [Bookit: Room Booking Application](https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking)

For my 2nd year computing project module, I collaborated in a group project to develop a responsive room booking web application with Node.js, Express, EJS and MySQL. Functionality for all users includes:

- Log in and out of an account
- Create and confirm bookings for a room at a given date and time
- Search for rooms filtered by criteria such as availability, capacity, etc.
- View and cancel any and all bookings made by user
- Edit/amend a booking in case of erroneous entry data
