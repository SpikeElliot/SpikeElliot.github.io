### [Gamified Guitar Song Learning Application (WIP)](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Gamified-Guitar-Song-Learning)

Currently in progress, this standalone software assists guitarists in the process of learning a song by ear. 

A pre-trained Machine Learning model is implemented to extract the guitar from an audio file. A user can then play along to the separated track with their connected electric guitar in a virtual practise environment providing audio playback options (e.g. looping or adjusting speed).

Also implemented is a karaoke-style note accuracy score derived from the the user's pitch and rhythm. This gives the user real-time feedback on performance as well as providing a gamified experience.
